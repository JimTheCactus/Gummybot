Gummybot
========
Not a whole lot to see here. Just a little toy I've been playing with off and on for the last few years that serves as an IRC bot for basic channel tools.

Version 3.0 of the Gummybot code is expected to completely rework the specifics of the implementation, depending entirely on PERL, POE, and POE::Component::IRC. However, the current version (as of 07/22/2014) is essentially a script for IRSSI and as such, demonstrates no modularization.
